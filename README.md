# Wordle

## Overview

We combined the concepts of Claude Shannon's Information Theory with the popular Wordle game, creating a self-playing Wordle game that makes the best word choices.




## Containing:

- GUI (made with the help of [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).)
- The concept of multithreading ( the graphic interface and the calculation function run at the same time on different threads )
- Claude Shannon's Information Theory
- Both Automated Version and Nonautomated Version
- Error handling

## The non-automated version

This project also contains the non-automated version. All you have to do to be able to play is to enter the "Unautomated Wordle" directory, download the code and run it in any IDE.

Some images from the non-automated version:


## Must know:

- Each word attempt has a 5 second delay to ensure that the function that calculates the next word has time to calculate it
- The words are in Romanian and were automatically scanned from several dictionaries, for this reason there are still some words that do not necessarily make sense.
- The average word finding is about 4
